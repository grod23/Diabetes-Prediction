# Diabetes-Prediction
About 2 in 7 adults are diagnosed with diabetes affecting millions worldwide. Diabetes disrupts how the body regulatutes sugar, often leading to serious helath conditions such as heart disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage. This project leverages a predictive model that utilizes 8 key health indicators to assess a patients likeilhood of having diabetes. The models anaylsis of these inputs aims to support early diagonisis and to assist health care providers. 
This model takes the following 8 inputs: 
1. **Pregnancies** — Number of times the patient has been pregnant
2. **Glucose** — Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)
3. **Blood Pressure** — Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. **Skin Thickness** — Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. **Insulin** — 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. **BMI** — Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. **Diabetes Pedigree Function** — A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
8. **Age** — Age of the patient (years)
